# Debroid CLI Debugger Skill

This skill covers the `debroid` CLI for headless Android debugging. The rules below keep the context window small and avoid execution errors.

## 🎯 Trigger Conditions
Activate this skill whenever the user or task involves:
- Debugging an Android application or process live
- Setting line breakpoints in Kotlin or Java source files (`debroid break`)
- Catching uncaught or caught runtime exceptions (`debroid catch-exception`)
- Inspecting live variables, object memory, or Jetpack Compose state (`debroid locals`, `pause-state`, `inspect`)
- Stepping through Kotlin/Java code execution (`debroid step`)
- Monitoring field access or modifications with watchpoints (`debroid watch`)
- Evaluating expressions or mutating variable values in runtime memory (`debroid eval`, `set-var`)

## Agent Rules
1. **Always use `--with-stacktrace`** when polling to get immediate context.
2. **Never poll in an infinite loop**. Poll once or twice, and if the app hasn't hit a breakpoint, instruct the user to interact with the app.
3. **Parse JSON outputs carefully**. All CLI outputs are JSON strings. Extract `sessionId`, `threadId`, `objectId`, `breakpointId`, `exceptionBreakpointId`, `watchpointId`, and `continuationId` **exactly as provided** and reuse them verbatim in subsequent commands. Do not synthesize IDs.
4. **Track trap IDs and remove them when done**. Every `break`, `catch-exception`, and `watch` returns an ID. Use `remove-break`, `remove-catch-exception`, `remove-watch` to clear traps you no longer need so they don't fire unexpectedly and waste poll cycles.
5. **Keep IDs in working memory, not in long scratch buffers.** A typical session uses 1–3 trap IDs plus 1 thread ID — keep them inline.
6. **Use Background Tasks**: If you are using an agentic system that supports background tasks, run `debroid daemon` as a background task.
7. **Token efficiency & Schema Inspection**: All JSON responses are compact single-line by default to conserve agent context tokens. If formatted multi-line JSON is required, append the `--pretty` flag to any JSON command. To inspect the expected output JSON structure for any command without running a session, pass the `--schema` flag (e.g., `debroid pause-state --schema`). Do not echo full responses back to the user verbatim — summarize the relevant fields (`valuePreview`, `type`, `objectId`, `location`).
8. **Self-Recovery**: If a session becomes unresponsive or gets out of sync, run `debroid stop` to cleanly terminate the daemon and release ADB ports. The next `debroid` command will auto-restart a fresh daemon.
9. **Report, but don't block**: If you hit unexpected Debroid behavior or have feedback on the tool itself, first try to resume the flow of what the user originally wanted to perform. Do not immediately jump to reporting the issue. At the end of your task, ask the user if they want to report the issue. See **"🐛 Reporting Bugs & Feedback"** below for details.

## 🔄 Standard Debugging Workflow

### Step 1: Start the Daemon
Debroid requires a persistent background daemon to communicate with the Android device via JDWP.
```bash
debroid daemon &
```
*(Wait 1-2 seconds for it to start). The first CLI command will also auto-start the daemon if it isn't running.*

### Step 2: Attach to the App
You must attach the debugger to obtain a `sessionId`.
- **If the user wants to debug app startup:**
  ```bash
  debroid launch <app_id>
  debroid break <session_id> <FileName.kt> <line_number> --package <pkg>
  debroid resume <session_id>
  ```
  > ⚠️ `launch` starts the app suspended via `am set-debug-app -w` and halts the VM with all threads suspended (`suspendedThreadsCount > 0`). Set your startup breakpoints or watchpoints immediately after `launch`, and then call `debroid resume <session_id>` so the VM proceeds with startup and hits your breakpoints. (Pass `--no-suspend` if you want the app to start executing immediately upon launch without waiting).
  > ⚠️ `launch` uses `am set-debug-app -w`. Debroid **automatically** clears this flag when you call `detach`, so the next normal (non-debug) launch of the app will not hang. Do not call `am clear-debug-app` yourself.
- **If the app is already running:**
  ```bash
  debroid attach <app_id>
  ```
  *(Pass `--suspend` if you want to suspend all threads immediately upon attaching).*
**Action:** Extract the `sessionId` from the JSON response.

> ⚠️ **Session Lifecycle & Breakpoints (Crucial!)**: 
> Breakpoints, watchpoints, and exception traps are strictly **session-scoped**. When you call `attach` or `launch` for an `app_id` that is already being debugged by an older/stale session, Debroid's automatic deduping will instantly safely detach that stale session. **This completely wipes all breakpoints and watchpoints you may have set previously.** You MUST recreate any breakpoints or watchpoints you need using your new `sessionId` returned by the new `attach`/`launch` command!

### Step 3: Set Traps
Set your breakpoints or watchpoints *before* polling. **Save the returned IDs.**
- **Line Breakpoint**: `debroid break <session_id> <FileName.kt> <line_number> [--package <pkg>] [--pretty]` → returns `{ "id": "bp_1", "verified": true|false, ... }`
  - **Always pass `--package`** when you know it (e.g. `--package com.example.app.search`). Providing the package name lets the daemon resolve the class with a single targeted lookup instead of scanning every loaded class across the entire VM, which takes seconds or minutes on large applications and drastically improves responsiveness.
  - If `verified=false`, the class isn't loaded yet. Debroid will **automatically** bind it the moment the class is prepared — you do **not** need to do anything; just poll. (No more deferred-breakpoint dead-ends.)
  - Use `remove-break <session_id> <breakpoint_id>` to clear it.
- **Exception Trap**: `debroid catch-exception <session_id> [ExceptionClass] [--caught] [--uncaught]`
  - Defaults: `--uncaught` ON, `--caught` OFF. Add `--caught` to also trap exceptions caught by the app.
  - Returns `{ "exceptionBreakpointId": "ex_bp_1" }`.
  - Remove with `remove-catch-exception <session_id> <exception_breakpoint_id>`.
- **Watchpoint**: `debroid watch <session_id> <com.pkg.Class> <fieldName> [--access] [--modify]`
  - Defaults: BOTH access and modify ON. Pass `--no-access` or `--no-modify` to disable either.
  - Returns `{ "watchpointId": "wp_1" }`.
  - Remove with `remove-watch <session_id> <watchpoint_id>`.

### Step 4: Poll for Events
You must poll the event queue to see if a trap was triggered.
```bash
debroid poll <session_id> <cursor> --with-stacktrace
```
* **Initial Cursor:** Always start with `"0"`.
* **Subsequent Cursors:** Use the `nextCursor` value from the previous JSON response.
* **Buffer Overflow & Stale Cursors:** Inspect `droppedEventsSinceLastPoll` (omitted from JSON when 0). If present and > 0, events were evicted from the buffer before they could be polled (e.g. due to high event volume or delayed polling). If an expected breakpoint or exception event is not present in `events`, it may have been among the dropped events.
* **Waiting:** If `events` is empty, ask the user to trigger the action in the app, then poll again.
* **Event types you may see:** `BREAKPOINT_HIT` (includes `breakpointId`), `STEP_HIT`, `EXCEPTION_HIT`, `WATCHPOINT_ACCESS_HIT`, `WATCHPOINT_MODIFY_HIT`, `DISCONNECT`.

### Step 5: Inspect the Pause State
Once `poll` returns an event (e.g., `BREAKPOINT_HIT`), extract the `threadId`.
Use the **Pause State Command** to get frames and locals at once:
```bash
debroid pause-state <session_id> <thread_id>
```

**Advanced Inspections:**
- Drill into complex objects: `debroid inspect <session_id> <object_id> [OPTIONS]`
  - `--max-depth N` recurses N levels deep into object fields. Responses include a `nested` map keyed by field name. Cycles are guarded automatically.
  - **Important Filter Behavior**: By default, `inspect` explicitly filters out `static` fields, `synthetic` fields, and ART-specific internal fields (`shadow$_*`). It also prevents redundant recursion into well-known immutable terminal types (like `java.lang.String` and Enums) to save your context tokens.
  - `--include-static` and `--include-internal` can be passed to bypass these filters if you absolutely need to inspect Dalvik internals or static class constants.
- Coroutine state: `debroid coroutine <session_id> <continuation_id>`

> **ObjectId Lifecycle & Reuse (Crucial!)**: 
> Any `objectId` or `continuation_id` returned by ANY command (including `locals`, `pause-state`, `poll` stacktraces, `eval`, or even inside a deeply nested `inspect` result) is globally cached by the daemon and **guaranteed to remain valid and reusable across multiple standalone commands** for the entire duration of the current suspend. You can confidently extract nested `objectId`s from a shallow inspect and drill into them later. These IDs are only invalidated/cleared when the VM is explicitly resumed (e.g. via `step`, `resume`) or detached.

### Step 6: Mutate or Step
- Mutate memory: `debroid set-var <session_id> <thread_id> <variableName> <newValue>`
  - **Important:** `newValue` is parsed as a Java expression! To set a String literal, you must wrap the value in escaped quotes (e.g., `\"my string\"`). To set it to the result of an expression, provide the expression (e.g., `5`, `true`, `varName + 1`, Int/Long: `10`, `100L`, Float/Double: `10.5f`, `20.5d`).
- Evaluate expressions: `debroid eval <session_id> <thread_id> "<expression>"`
  - **Expression Engine**: Supports compound boolean/logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`), relational comparisons (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`), arithmetic, and idiomatic Kotlin/Java expressions.
  - **Supported Capabilities**:
    - **Compound Logic & Relational**: Evaluate expressions directly (e.g., `amount >= 600.0 && isExpress`, `(x > 5 || y == 0) && !flag`).
    - **Kotlin Properties & Getters**: Access Kotlin properties directly (e.g., `order.amount` or `user.name`) — automatically resolves backing fields or getter methods (`getAmount()`, `isExpress()`).
    - **Safe Calls & Elvis**: Supports safe navigation and fallback defaults (e.g., `user?.address?.city`, `user?.name ?: "Unknown"`).
    - **Type Casting & Checks**: Supports safe and unsafe type casts and type checks (e.g., `(user as Admin).permissions`, `user as? Admin ?: defaultAdmin`, `order is Order`, `42 as Long`).
    - **Method Calls & Arithmetic**: Supports method invocations, parameter passing, and math operators (e.g., `order.getAmount() * 0.15`, `processor.calculateTotal(order)`).
    - **Static Methods, Constants & Singletons**: Supports calling static methods and accessing static constants. **Encouraged Best Practice: Prefer fully-qualified class names** (e.g., `java.lang.Math.max(10, 20)`, `android.util.Log.d("Tag", "msg")`, `java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis()`, `java.lang.Integer.MAX_VALUE`, `com.example.OrderConfig.currency`, `com.example.OrderValidator.isValid(50.0)`). Standard default imports (`java.lang.*`, `java.util.*`, `kotlin.*`, `kotlin.math.*`, `android.util.*`, etc.) and classes in the active stack frame's package are also resolved automatically when unqualified.
    - **Kotlin Objects & Companion Functions**: Supports standalone Kotlin `object` singletons (e.g., `OrderConfig.formatCurrency(100.0)`), companion object properties/methods (`OrderValidator.MIN_AMOUNT`), and `@JvmStatic` methods.
    - **Field Inspection**: To view an object's instance fields in detail, retrieve its `objectId` from `locals` or `pause-state` and use `debroid inspect <session_id> <object_id>`.
  - **🚫 Unsupported & Impossible in `eval` (DO NOT ATTEMPT IN SESSIONS)**:
    - **Kotlin Extension Functions syntax (`receiver.extFunc()`):** Extension functions are compiled to static methods in file facade classes (e.g., `StringExtKt.extFunc(receiver)`). They are NOT instance methods on the receiver. To call an extension function, invoke it explicitly via its fully-qualified static facade class: `com.example.utils.StringExtKt.extFunc(receiver)`.
    - **Lambdas & Higher-Order Functions:** Passing inline closures/lambdas (e.g., `list.map { it.name }`, `items.filter { it.price > 10 }`, `list.forEach { ... }`) is NOT supported by the runtime JDI evaluator (cannot synthesize anonymous classes at runtime).
    - **Control Flow Statements:** `if-else` statements, `when` blocks, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), `try-catch`, `return`, `throw`, etc. are not supported. Use elvis `?:` or boolean logic expressions instead.
    - **Variable Declarations & Assignments:** Declaring new variables (`val x = 10`) or direct assignment statements (`x = 20`) in `eval` is not supported. Use `debroid set-var <session_id> <thread_id> <var_name> <new_value>` to mutate existing variables.
    - **Object Instantiation via `new` / Constructor calls:** Creating new object instances via constructors (e.g., `User("Alice")`, `new HashMap()`) is not supported.
    - **Coroutines & `suspend` Functions:** Calling `suspend` functions directly inside `eval` is not supported. Inspect active continuation frames using `debroid coroutine <session_id> <continuation_id>`.
    - **Direct Access to Private Fields without Getters:** To inspect private fields without public accessors, use `debroid inspect <session_id> <object_id>` instead of `eval`.
- Step execution: `debroid step <session_id> <thread_id> <ACTION>` (Actions: `STEP_OVER`, `STEP_INTO`, `STEP_OUT`, `RESUME_THREAD`, `RESUME_ALL`)
- Resume all threads: `debroid resume <session_id>`
  > Note: `resume` resumes **all** threads in the VM. For per-thread resume, use `step <session_id> <thread_id> RESUME_THREAD`.

### Step 7: Clean Up
When debugging is complete, cleanly detach:
```bash
debroid detach <session_id>
```
> If the session was opened with `launch`, `detach` automatically runs `adb shell am clear-debug-app` so the user's app resumes normal behavior. You do **not** need to clear it manually.

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls & Error Recovery
- **Error: "Failed to communicate with daemon"**: The daemon isn't running. Run `debroid daemon &`.
- **Error: "AbsentInformationException"**: The app is not debuggable or was obfuscated by ProGuard. Ensure `android:debuggable="true"` in the Manifest.
- **Missing Local Variables**: If locals are empty, you might be at a method entry point. Run a `STEP_OVER` and check again.
- **Inspecting Complex Objects**: If an object does not expose public properties or methods, retrieve its `objectId` from `locals` or `pause-state` and use `debroid inspect <session_id> <object_id>` to view all private fields recursively.
- **`break` returns `verified=false`**: NOT a failure — the class will be loaded later and the breakpoint will be bound automatically. Keep your `bp` id and proceed.
- **A trap no longer needed**: Remove it. Lingering exception traps in particular can fire on every exception the app throws, flooding your poll results.
- **Jetpack Compose Breakpoints**: Place line breakpoints on executable statements inside `@Composable` function bodies (e.g. `val x = ...`), not on the `@Composable fun Name(...)` signature header line where no bytecode is generated.
- **Jetpack Compose State Delegates**: Compose `remember { mutableStateOf(...) }` or `collectAsState()` variables appear as `<varName>$delegate` in `pause-state` or `locals`. To inspect Compose state values, retrieve the `objectId` of the `$delegate` object and use `debroid inspect <session_id> <object_id>`.
- **Autonomous UI Interaction**: Instead of asking the user to click buttons on the device, inspect the UI bounds using `android layout --pretty` (prefer `android-cli` if installed) or `adb shell uiautomator dump /sdcard/window_dump.xml && adb shell cat /sdcard/window_dump.xml`, locate the target element's `bounds="[minX,minY][maxX,maxY]"`, calculate the center coordinates `(minX + maxX)/2`, and simulate a tap with `adb shell input tap X Y`.
- **`detached` of `launch`'d session and app won't start normally**: Should not happen — `detach` clears `am set-debug-app`. If it does (e.g. daemon was forcibly killed), run `adb shell am clear-debug-app` once.
- **Daemon or Session Unresponsive**: Run `debroid stop` to terminate the background server and clear ADB port forwards. The next `debroid` command will automatically spawn a fresh, clean daemon.
- **Daemon Startup Failures**: If the auto-spawned daemon fails to start, review the surfaced startup diagnostics in the error output or inspect `~/.debroid/daemon.log` for full details.

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs & Feedback (Debroid Tool Itself)

If you hit unexpected Debroid behavior (a crash, a wrong/malformed result, a stuck session `debroid stop` doesn't fix) — not a bug in the app you're debugging — or have feedback on the tool itself, **do not immediately jump to reporting the issue**.

1. First, try to resume the flow of what the user originally wanted to perform or find a workaround to complete their task.
2. At the very end of your response or task completion, ask the user: "Would you like me to report the issue we encountered with Debroid?"
3. **Only if the user explicitly says yes**, proceed to fetch the full reporting workflow (sanitizing details, exact report format, mandatory user confirmation, filing via `gh`):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatilShreyas/debroid/main/skills/debroid-cli/references/reporting-feedback.md
```
Then follow it exactly.

## 📊 Token-Efficient JSON Extraction & Querying Guidelines

To keep context windows clean and minimize token consumption during debugging sessions:

1. **Direct Output Reading (Default for Small/Medium Commands)**:
   - For `attach`, `launch`, `break`, `locals`, `pause-state`, `set-var`, `eval`: Read `stdout` directly into context memory. Single-line compact responses take only ~50-80 tokens.
2. **Filtering Large Payloads via `jq` / Python (When Payload is Large)**:
   - For deep `inspect` queries (`-d 2+`) or long event `poll` responses with stacktraces, pass `--schema` upfront to know key names, then pipe output through `jq` in the shell to extract target fields before reading into context:
     ```bash
     # Filter specific local variable from pause-state:
     debroid pause-state <session_id> <thread_id> | jq '.locals[] | select(.name=="targetVar")'

     # Extract specific field during deep object inspection:
     debroid inspect <session_id> <object_id> -d 2 | jq '.fields.order'

     # Extract event types and exception messages from poll:
     debroid poll <session_id> <cursor> --with-stacktrace | jq '.events[] | {eventType, className, exceptionMessage}'
     ```
3. **Direct VM Expression Querying (`eval`)**:
   - To query a single calculated primitive value or method result (e.g. `order.getAmount()` or `list.size()`), call `debroid eval <session_id> <thread_id> "<expr>"`. This evaluates the expression directly in the Dalvik/ART VM and returns a tiny single-value payload (< 20 tokens).

## 📖 Complete CLI Command Reference
Here is the full list of commands and their signatures (note: all commands support global options `-p, --port <int>` / `DEBROID_PORT` environment variable, `--version`, and `-h, --help`; all JSON commands accept an optional `--pretty` flag to format response JSON, and an eager `--schema` flag to inspect output types):
