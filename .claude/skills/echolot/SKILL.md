description: The door to echolot — localise Android performance regressions from a Perfetto trace, from the metric down to a place in the code. /echolot with nothing after it reads the project's state and takes the next step (install the layer, build the config, or hunt); with an argument it does that. Use when cold start regressed, scrolling stutters, TTI grew, a benchmark dropped, or there is a .perfetto-trace to analyse. Also for questions like "why is startup slow", "where does main thread time go", "what is burning CPU".

# echolot

A deterministic layer between the Perfetto trace and you.

## The one rule

**Never open the trace yourself.** No hand-rolled TraceProcessor, no ad-hoc
SQL, no reading `.perfetto-trace`. A trace is tens of megabytes and hundreds of
thousands of slices; everything you need, `echolot` hands you as a table of
about twenty rows.

Live proportions: an 81 MB trace with 475k slices compresses into a 14 KB
`report.json`. Six thousand times smaller, and it takes five seconds.

If the report seems to be missing data, that is not a reason to open the trace.
It is a reason to fix the config (anchors that did not match, the wrong
process), to add instrumentation and re-record, or to add a detector.

## `/echolot` is the door

When you are invoked as `/echolot`, do not guess what the human wants from
the state of the project — ask the tool. First:

```bash
echolot            # where things stand: layer, config, traces, report, doctor — and `next`
```

Show that output to the human as it is, then act on the `next` line
(`echolot status --next` gives it as one word):

| `next` | what you do |
|---|---|
| `init` / `init-force` | run `echolot init` (with `--force` when it says so), show the result; then run `echolot` again and continue from its new `next` |
| `doctor` | run `echolot doctor`, show what failed, stop — no report is trustworthy until it passes |
| `setup` | invoke the `echolot-setup` skill (the Skill tool) — it builds `echolot.yml` |
| `fix-config` | show the parse error, ask the human to fix `echolot.yml`, stop |
| `resume-or-new` | **ask before attaching to anything** — see below |
| `hunt` | invoke the `echolot-hunt` skill (the Skill tool) — **never run the loop here**; it asks what regressed and hands the work to `perf-hunter`, waiting for its answer |

## `resume-or-new`: whose question are we answering

An investigation is open, it left traces and a report on disk, and nobody has
worked on it for a while. Attaching to that history without asking is how a
question about scrolling gets answered with cold-start traces.

`echolot` has already printed the recap under the table — the question, when it
was last worked on, how many traces it would reuse, what the last report said,
and anything that drifted since. **Show that recap as it is**, then ask with
`AskUserQuestion`:

| the human picks | what you do |
|---|---|
| carry on | `echolot hunt --resume`, then the `echolot-hunt` skill with the recorded question |
| something new | `echolot hunt "<their question>" --since "<the change, or unknown>"`, then the `echolot-hunt` skill |
| just show the report | print `.echolot/out/report.md` and stop |

Lean towards "something new" when the recap shows a `!` line — the scenario
changed, the config changed, or it has been untouched for over a week.

`echolot hunt "<question>"` moves the previous set of traces aside before anything is
recorded, so the new investigation cannot inherit them, and it says on stderr
if the previous one left `AGENTTMP_` markers in the sources. **Deal with those
before hunting**: `echolot mark --remove` takes out what `mark --apply` wrote,
and anything added by hand has to go by hand. Instrumentation nobody meant to
leave behind is the starting condition of the next investigation otherwise.

When the human's own words already name a different question — `/echolot why
does the list stutter` while the open investigation is about cold start — still
ask, but offer "something new" first with their words filled in. A new
formulation is sometimes a sharper version of the same hunt.

Two things this is never asked about. Inside `perf-hunter`'s loop: it
re-records and re-instruments on purpose, works inside an investigation it was
handed, and never calls `status` at all. And within half an hour of the last
`collect` or `analyze` — that is the same sitting, and `next` says `hunt`.

With an argument, the argument wins over the state:

- `/echolot init` — run `echolot init`. Not setup: `init` installs or
  updates **this** layer; the config is setup's job.
- `/echolot setup` — the `echolot-setup` skill.
- `/echolot hunt <words>` — the `echolot-hunt` skill, with the words as what
  regressed. `/echolot <free text>` about slowness ("why is startup slow",
  "the list stutters since the redesign") means the same.
- `/echolot doctor`, `/echolot status`, `/echolot analyze …` — run that
  command, show the output.
- `/echolot hunt <words>` — that question, without asking first. It is the
  same word as `echolot hunt <words>` in a shell, and does the same thing
  plus the loop: the CLI half opens the investigation, the agent half runs it.

Every argument after `/echolot` is a CLI verb of the same name, except
`setup` — that one needs an agent and has no shell half. Where a verb has
both, `/echolot X` runs `echolot X` and then whatever loop it needs.
- `/echolot reflect` — the `echolot-reflect` skill: how the last session
  went, what to change in the tool.

`/echolot-setup`, `/echolot-hunt` and `/echolot-reflect` still exist for
whoever knows where they are going; `/echolot` is the door for everyone else.

## The order of work

```bash
echolot doctor -q               # does the environment compute correctly?
echolot analyze <trace> -c echolot.yml
```

`analyze` writes `.echolot/out/report.json` (for you) and `report.md` (for
humans), next to the config. Read the **json** — it has a stable schema.

No config? That is `next: setup`. No idea what is in the trace?
`echolot probe <trace> --process '<package>*'`.

**Silence is relative to the thresholds.** The report's `Config:` line and
`detectors[].params_source` say whether the numbers are the shipped defaults
or calibrated ones. Calibrated on the runs that hold the regression means the
bar sits above it: look with `echolot analyze … --defaults` before calling a
run clean.

## Two reports, one question

`analyze` says where the time went in one set of traces. "It was 3 s, now it is
7 s" needs two sets, and subtracting two twenty-row tables by reading them is
the work this tool exists to remove.

```bash
echolot compare                      # inside an investigation: previous round vs latest
echolot compare --hunt 3             # its first report against its last
echolot compare old.json new.json    # or name them
```

One table sorted by how far each row moved, plus `comparison.json` beside the
report. Three things decide how to read it:

- **`change`** — `appeared`, `grew`, `shrank`, `vanished`, `steady`. An
  appeared row is usually the answer.
- **`overlap`** — `false` means the two sets of repeats are apart and the move
  survives a re-record; `true` means they disagree among themselves by more
  than the medians moved, so record another round before concluding; `null`
  means one side was a single trace.
- **`warnings`** — reasons the two may not be comparable. `thresholds` is the
  one to read first: against a moved bar, appeared and gone mean "the bar
  moved", not "the app changed". `instrumentation` names rows that appeared
  because you added `AGENTTMP_` markers between the rounds.

## When what arrived is an ANR, not a regression

Sometimes the question is not "it was 3 s, now it is 7 s" but a report from
Crashlytics, Play Console, or the device's own drop box: the app stopped
answering somewhere you cannot see. Different first move, and most of it needs
no device and no trace.

```bash
echolot anr report.txt --root .
```

Reads and prints — it opens no investigation and writes nothing, so a folder of
exports goes through it in one loop and the ones worth chasing are the ones
that name a lock chain.

| what it says | your next move |
|---|---|
| a lock chain with the main thread behind it | you have the mechanism. Open the holder's frames; no trace needed |
| the main thread was **idle** (`nativePollOnce`) | it was not the culprit. Read the threads that were working |
| frames placed in the checkout | open those lines |
| frames landing nowhere | check out the build the report names — line numbers go stale first |

The idle main thread is the case that wastes a day if you miss it: the dump is
a snapshot taken five seconds in, and whatever caused the freeze had often let
go by then. Reading its top frame as the culprit sends you into Android's
message queue.

Then `echolot mark --from-anr report.txt` proposes markers on the methods that
were on the stack, and refuses the ones that would lie — a line that falls in a
different function than the frame names, a `return` in the body, a one-line
body. Show the reasons rather than working around them.

To measure a freeze rather than read about one, record long enough for
`anr_risk` and `anr` to see it: `duration_ms: 12000` does not hold a
five-second freeze plus the five the system waits before declaring anything.

## Reading the report

Details live in `references/report.md`; three things here that you will get
wrong without them.

**Silent detectors matter as much as firing ones.** They stay in the report
with empty `rows`. Silence means that ground was checked and is clean — do not
go there.

**`self_ms` versus `total_ms`.** Self time, with children subtracted, is where
the time actually went. `traversal` with `total_ms: 354` and `self_ms: 79` does
almost nothing itself; dig into its children. Never add `total_ms` across rows:
they nest inside one another.

**Warnings inside `window`.** If `start_anchor.matches == 0`, the window
expanded to the whole trace and none of the numbers are about your scenario.
Fix the config rather than hunting a problem. Same for `process_alternatives` —
you may be analysing the wrong process.

**`frame_jank` is about single frames, not totals.** The other six aggregate by
name and gate on sums, which is right for "cold start got slower" and blind to
a heavy tail: one 86 ms frame among thousands disappears into every sum there
is. This one reads SurfaceFlinger's per-frame record instead, so it needs no
instrumentation and answers a question the rest cannot.

Its `total_ms` and `max_ms` are time **past the deadline**; the frame's own
length is in `detail`, which is where a benchmark's percentiles can be matched.
`detail` also leads with the platform's verdict on whose deadline was missed —
`Self Jank` is the app, `Other Jank` is the compositor and is not something to
go into the code over.

Its silence is ambiguous: no bad frames, and no frame timeline in the trace at
all, look the same. Android 11 and below have none, and neither does a capture
that did not ask for it. Check before calling a scenario smooth.

## From a finding to the code

1. A firing detector gives you a `location` — a slice or thread name.
2. The `domains` section of `echolot.yml` maps that name to a module and file.
3. Not in `domains`? Grep the repository for the slice name: it is a string
   literal inside `trace("...")`, survives minification, and is found exactly.
4. Nothing found? The slice is most likely a system one (`bindApplication`,
   `Choreographer#doFrame`, `binder transaction`). See `references/naming.md`.

When `uninstrumented_cpu` fires there is no code behind the finding by
definition: the thread burned CPU with no instrumentation. That is an address
for adding `trace{}`, not the location of a bug.

**`main_thread_outlier` is not `main_thread_block` again.** One gates on the
sum for a name and answers "where did the time go"; the other gates on a
single occurrence against the median for that same name and answers "which one
was out of line". A name in both is telling you two things.

They lead to different places in the code. Expensive every time means the fix
is in that work. Usually fine and once not means the cause is the state it hit
that once — a cold cache, a lock, a first-run path. `detail` carries the median
and how many occurrences it came from, which is what to hold a benchmark's
percentiles against.

## Boundaries

The tool **localises one specific regression**: you know "it was 3 s, now it is
7 s" and need to find where. It does not search for the unknown across a pile
of traces.

Networking in benchmarks is mocked on purpose — we hunt problems in code, not
network speed.

Thresholds are tied to a device and a scenario. When either changes, run
`echolot calibrate` on healthy runs instead of nudging numbers by hand.

When the question is about the tool rather than the app — "how did that
session go, what should change in echolot" — that is `/echolot reflect`
(the `echolot-reflect` skill), not a hunt.
