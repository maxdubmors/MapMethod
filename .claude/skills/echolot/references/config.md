# echolot.yml — the contract between the engine and the project

It lives in the Android project root and is committed. Read it like
`gradle.properties`: one tool per machine, the binding to a project inside that
project's repository.

Machine-local things (device serials, a path to your own
`trace_processor_shell`) go into `local.yml` next to it, which sits in
`.gitignore`. The merge is recursive and local wins; when it is applied, the
CLI says so on stderr.

## What the code reads today

```yaml
project:
  package: com.example.app
  process: com.example.app     # GLOB over process.name
  source_root: app/src/main/kotlin

scenario:
  name: coldStart
  start:
    name: "bindApplication"
    _source: derived           # derived | confirmed_by_user | default
    _evidence: "probe: top slices, 245 ms on main"
  end:
    name: "Choreographer#doFrame*"
  budget_ms: 2500              # not read by the code yet, see below

runner:
  mode: launch                 # launch | command | gradle
  iterations: 5
  duration_ms: 12000
  reset_policy: force-stop     # force-stop (cold) | none (warm)
  environment: true            # record CPU clock, thermal, memory

detectors:
  main_thread_block:
    min_slice_ms: 26.6

instrumentation:
  allowed: ["app/src/main", "feature/*/src/main"]
  temp_prefix: AGENTTMP_
```

### `project.process`

A GLOB, not an exact name. An app usually has several processes
(`:pushservice`, `:webview`), and `com.example.app*` catches them all. The CLI
takes the largest by slice count and **says so** — on stderr and in
`report.json` as `process_alternatives`. If the wrong process is being
analysed, narrow the mask.

### `scenario.start` / `scenario.end`

A GLOB over the slice name. Start is the first occurrence. End is where the
**first** anchor starting after that ends.

Both are optional: without them the window is the whole trace. For a trace from
a macrobenchmark that is fine — it has already cut out the measured block.

Names like `Choreographer#doFrame 55112` carry a vsync number that changes from
run to run. Such an anchor needs a wildcard.

**An anchor that did not match makes the report lie silently**, which is why
the CLI puts `matches` into `window`. Check it before drawing conclusions.

### `scenario.budget_ms`

Declared and **not read by the code**, deliberately: there is no performance
gate and none is planned. Do not build logic on it and do not expect a run to
fail when it is exceeded.

The question a budget answers — "did it get slower" — is already answered by
the benchmark that produced the trace, and thresholds evaluated on a shared CI
runner fire on properties of the runner. What echolot contributes is the other
question, *where* the time went, so in CI it belongs after the gate rather than
in it: `doctor -q` as a precondition, then `analyze`, with `report.json` kept
as a build artefact for whoever asks later.

Keeping the field is still worthwhile: it records what the team considers
acceptable, and it survives a change of device better than memory does.

### `runner`

`mode: launch` drives the scenario itself: force-stop, record, `am start -W`.
`mode: command` lets something else drive it (adb input, uiautomator, maestro,
your own script) while the trace records around it. `mode: gradle` runs a
macrobenchmark task and gathers the traces it wrote.

`reset_policy` is `force-stop` or `none`. `pm clear` is deliberately
unsupported: wiping data changes the scenario rather than repeating it.

`environment: true` records what the device was doing to the app while the
scenario ran — CPU frequency, thermal throttling, free memory, and the kernel
function a thread went to sleep on. It reaches the report as `environment`,
and `compare` reads it to tell a slower machine from a slower app. Turning it
off is for a device whose buffer overflows; the report then says the device
state was not recorded, which is a different answer from "it held steady".

### `detectors`

Thresholds, per detector, and nothing else. Naming one leaves the rest
running on the numbers they shipped with — you do not have to list them all
to tune one.

To turn a detector off, say so:

```yaml
detectors:
  main_thread_block:
    min_slice_ms: 26.6
  frame_jank: false        # this device has no frame timeline
```

`false` is the only way out. Until 0.5.4 the section doubled as an allowlist,
so a config naming six detectors ran six — and on a real project four sat out
for weeks because a calibrated section had been tidied.

The values override the `@param` defaults in the `.sql` files. Besides numbers
they include name masks: `*name_glob*` over the slice name, `*thread_glob*`
over the thread, `*skip_glob*` for exclusions. They live in the config because
ART names things differently across Android versions, and adapting to a device
must not require editing a query.

Thresholds are not picked by hand: `echolot calibrate` derives them from
healthy runs and prints a ready section with the reasoning attached.

### `instrumentation`

Where the agent may write temporary markers, and what to prefix them with.
`mark` reads both: a candidate outside `allowed` is refused with the nearest
allowed caller named instead, and `--remove` takes out exactly what carries the
prefix. `compare` reads the prefix too, to tell rows that appeared because
markers were added between the rounds from rows that appeared because the app
did something new.

`cleanup: always` is for the agent, and says the markers come out whether the
hunt concluded or ran out of rounds.

### Provenance

`_source` and `_evidence` give three things: a human sees what to double-check,
an agent knows that `confirmed_by_user` is untouchable, and when debugging you
can see where a piece of nonsense came from.

**The rule:** every field is justified by a finding. A slice name only if it
was found in the code or in the trace, with a `file:line` or a table row.
Nothing found — write `null` and say so out loud, do not invent something
plausible.

## What the agent reads, and the code never does

```yaml
domains:                        # the slice-to-code map
  - slice: "collection_mapping"
    module: ":feature:collection"
    hint: "CollectionMapper.kt — entity→domain"

loop:
  max_rounds: 3
  on_exhausted: report
```

`domains` is the central abstraction: it turns a marker into a hypothesis
without scanning the repository blindly, and blind scanning is the main context
eater. `echolot domains` pre-fills it from the sources.

`loop.max_rounds` is the one number a human sets to bound a hunt. Stopping is
not left to the agent's judgement: it has no goal of its own to economise.

## Read by nobody yet

```yaml
threads:
  own: ["DefaultDispatch*", "arch_disk_io_*"]
  ignore: ["HeapTaskDaemon", "Jit thread pool"]
```

Which threads carry the application's own work, and which are the runtime's
housekeeping. Nothing consumes it today — not the CLI, not the agent — so it
records an intention and changes no run. Do not read a finding out of it, and
do not tell anyone a thread was ignored because it is listed here.

It is worth writing down anyway: `uninstrumented_cpu` reports any thread over
its bar, and separating the housekeeping from the application's own work is
currently left to whoever reads the report.

Masks rather than names, because `comm` is truncated to fifteen characters:
`DefaultDispatcher-worker-1` arrives as `DefaultDispatch` and the whole pool
comes under that single name, while digits inside the cut survive and
`arch_disk_io_*` still matches four distinct threads. See
[naming.md](naming.md).
